               <p> In August/Spetember during the Term 3 Assesment Week, here what Henderson High School had to say about it - </p>
               <p> Assessment Week gave our Level 3 Hospitality students the chance to put their skills into action for their coffee assessment. With two full classes in attendance, the Beats Café was buzzing as the students cooked and served coffee all day. </p>
<p>Even though the students were being assessed on their Barista skills, Hospitality Teacher Ms Ablett challenged them to do a full service café. This gave them the opportunity to experience what a busy café is really like. Ms Ablett was impressed with the students. “They coped really well under pressure and being on their feet all day, and they showed great team work in the simulated real life café situation, well done students!”</p>
